 

Step 10: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer

 

Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the master branch doesn't exist in the master branch on your local machine.

 

In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the **git pull origin master** command (when working on the master branch).

 

This shows you all the files that have changed and how they've changed.

 

Now we can use the [**git log** ](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)command again to see all new commits.

 

 

(You may need to switch branches back to the master branch. You can do that using the **git checkout master** command.)

 

Step 11: Bask in your git glory

 

 

You've successfully made a PR and merged your code to the master branch. Congratulations! If you'd like to dive a little deeper, check out the files in [this Git101 folder ](https://github.com/cubeton/git101/tree/master/TurtorialInfo)for even more tips and tricks on using git and GitHub.

 

I also recommend finding some time to work with your team on simulating a smaller group project like we did here. Have your team make a new folder with your team name, and add some files with text to it. Then, try pushing those changes to this remote repo. That way, your team can start making changes to files they didn't originally create and practice using the

 

PR feature. And, use the git blame and git history tools on GitHub to get


 

 

familiar with tracking which changes have been made in a file and who made those changes.

 

The more you use git, the more comfortable you'll... git with it. (I couldn't resist.)
